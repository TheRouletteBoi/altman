## ⚠️ Important risk notice

Using account managers, multi-instance tools, or automation-related features may:

* Violate Roblox’s Terms of Service depending on usage
* Trigger automated moderation or anti-cheat systems
* Result in warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans

AltMan does **not** attempt to bypass Roblox security systems. However, any tool that manages cookies or launches multiple clients carries inherent risk.

**You are solely responsible for how you use this app.**

Never share your cookies, executables, or configuration files with anyone.
